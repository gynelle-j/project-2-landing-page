        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Usagi is kind and gentle, she is also considered helpful in school. and she is smart but not a nerd she loves cooking she loves her friends she never let them down she don't want to see anyone hurt.</p>

          <p>However, it was shown that she cares very deeply for her friends and family. She is very trusting and believes that everyone has a better nature. This could be seen as both a character strength and a character flaw at times. She did not believe in killing innocent humans, even when they had been transformed into vicious monsters, and always sought ways to heal them instead. And she does have severe problems fighting monsters and villains.</p>
          
        <p>Over the course of the series, Usagi matured a great deal although she was still prone to some childish behavior and bouts of silliness; she became a capable young woman.

        <h2>Bio</h2>
        <p>After rushing to school because she overslept, she spots some kids tormenting a black cat; putting band-aids on the cat's forehead. After Usagi chases the boys away, she removes the band-aids to reveal a crescent moon on the cat's forehead.</p>

<p>Later, Usagi received a poor grade on her exam and tries to toss it away. The crumpled up paper hit a man on the head, named Mamoru Chiba, who then began taunting her throughout the first half of the season.</p>

<p>It was later that night that the cat, named Luna, spoke to Usagi about the new enemy attacking Earth; the Dark Kingdom. To prove that it was not a dream, Luna gave her a magic brooch that allowed Usagi to become Sailor Moon. It was on her first mission where she met the mysterious Tuxedo Mask and had crushes on him from then on.</p>

<p>For a while, Usagi struggled on with school, as well as the fight against the Dark Kingdom on her own -with the help of Tuxedo Mask. Eventually, she was joined by school genius Ami Mizuno; a classmate of Usagi's who Luna suspected might be a youma. Ami was later revealed to be Sailor Mercury.</p>
